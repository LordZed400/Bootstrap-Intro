#Bootstrap Introduction

This is a simple Web Application made to give introduction about Bootstrap using Bootstrap. It is a more hands-on approach for teaching beginners why Bootstrap is needed and how it is used.  
It gives basic knowledge regarding Stylizing and Responsive Design.  
It uses basic ``HTML``, ``CSS`` and a bit of ``JQuery`` for creating the content and then uses ``Bootstrap`` to make it responsive.


#NOTE:
This Project uses Bootstrap 4.0.0 Which is in Beta, so most of the Bootstrap classes and codes may not work.
