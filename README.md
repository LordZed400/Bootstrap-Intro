# Bootstrap Introduction

This is a simple Web Application made to give an Introduction to Bootstrap using Bootstrap. It is a more hands-on approach for teaching beginners why Bootstrap is needed and how it is used.  
It gives basic knowledge regarding **Stylizing** and **Responsive Design**.  

It uses basic `HTML`, `CSS` and a bit of `JQuery` for creating the content and then uses ``Bootstrap`` to make it responsive.
